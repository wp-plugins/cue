Create beautiful, fully responsive audio playlists.

== Description ==

Cue gives you the ability to easily create stylish playlists and display them anywhere on your site using a widget, shortcode or template tag. Upload new audio files, reuse existing files in your media library, or even link to remote sources.

* Reorder tracks with a simple drag and drop interface.
* Seamlessly integrates with WordPress' media manager to select audio and images.
* Completely responsive to work on any device that supports your chosen audio format.
* Extends the MediaElement.js script bundled with core.

= AudioTheme Integration =

Cue was originally built for the [AudioTheme Framework](http://audiotheme.com/), but we wanted everyone to have the ability to easily create beautiful playlists, so we're releasing it free for general use. Additional integration is built into our framework to extend Cue and allow tracks in your discography to be used as sources for playlist tracks.

== Installation ==

Install Cue like any other plugin. [Check out the codex](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Installing_Plugins) if you have any questions.

= Usage =

After installing and activating Cue, a new menu item labelled **Playlists** will be available. Create a new playlist and add tracks by uploading or selecting existing audio files to add (remote sources can be used as well). Track details are populated automatically using tags in the audio file, but the details may also be managed manually.

**Shortcode**

To display a playlist in a post, page or CPT, insert the `[cue]` shortcode into the editor and specify the playlist id as an attribute. When editing a playlist, the shortcode is available for copying in a meta box just under the publish button.

**Widget**

Visit **Appearance &rarr; Widgets** and add the Playlist widget to a sidebar. Enter a widget title if desired and select the playlist you want to display. That's it!

**Template Tag**

For more fine-grained control over where the playlist appears, a template tag is available.

`<?php cue_playlist( $id ); ?>`
